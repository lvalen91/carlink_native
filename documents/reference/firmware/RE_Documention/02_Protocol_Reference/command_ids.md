# CPC200-CCPA Command (0x08) Reference

**Status:** Documented from binary analysis
**Source:** ARMadb-driver_unpacked binary analysis
**Firmware Version:** 2025.10.15.1127 (binary analysis reference version)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 (Added 14 new commands: 400-403, 410-412, 600-601, 700-702; renamed 502/503; updated gap ranges)

> **Context:** Command IDs are 4-byte little-endian payloads carried in Command (0x08) messages over the USB protocol between the Android host app and the CPC200-CCPA adapter firmware. Commands 1-31 are universal (both CarPlay and Android Auto sessions). Commands 100-314 and 400-702 are CarPlay-specific. Commands 500-509 are Android Auto focus commands.

---

## Overview

The Command message type (0x08) is **bidirectional** - commands flow in both directions between host and adapter. The adapter acts as a bridge, forwarding many commands between the host application and the connected phone (CarPlay/Android Auto).

## Command Direction Reference

This section classifies commands by flow direction. For per-ID details, see the [Command ID Reference Tables](#command-id-reference-tables) below.

### Host → Adapter → Phone (H→A→P) — Forwarded to Phone

These commands are sent by the host and **forwarded to the connected phone** via CarPlay/Android Auto protocol.

**Firmware handler:** `0x2047e` - logs "Forward CarPlay control cmd!" then dispatches

| ID Range | Group | Summary |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Mic Recording | StartRecordMic, StopRecordMic |
| 5-6 | Siri/Assistant | SiriButtonDown/Up — initiates voice assistant from host side |
| 100-106 | CtrlButton_* | D-Pad navigation (Left, Right, Up, Down, Enter, Release, Back) |
| 111-114 | CtrlKnob_* | Rotary knob input (Left, Right, Up, Down) |
| 200-205 | Music* | Media control (Home, Play, Pause, Toggle, Next, Prev) |
| 300-314 | PhoneCall/PhoneKey_* | Call control (Answer, HangUp) + DTMF tones (0-9, *, #) + HookSwitch |
| 400-403 | LaunchApp* | App launch (Maps, Phone, Music, NowPlaying) — CarPlay only |
| 410-412 | UI Control | ShowUI, StopUI, SuggestUI — CarPlay only |
| 700-702 | CusCommand_* | Volume forwarding, HFP call start/stop — CarPlay only |

### Host → Adapter (H→A) — Handled by Adapter Only

These commands are processed by the adapter firmware and **NOT forwarded** to the phone.

| ID Range | Group | Summary |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 7-8, 15, 21 | Mic Routing | UseCarMic, UseBoxMic, UseBoxI2SMic, UsePhoneMic |
| 12, 26 | Video | RequestKeyFrame, RefreshFrame |
| 16-17 | Night Mode | StartNightMode, StopNightMode |
| 18-19 | GNSS | StartGNSSReport, StopGNSSReport |
| 22-23 | Audio Routing | UseBluetoothAudio, UseBoxTransAudio |
| 24-25 | WiFi Band | Use24GWiFi, Use5GWiFi |
| 28-29 | Standby | StartStandbyMode, StopStandbyMode |
| 30-31 | BLE | StartBleAdv, StopBleAdv |
| 600-601 | DVR | DVRCommand_RequestPreview, ScanAndConnect — dead code, no hardware |
| 1000-1002, 1012-1013 | Connection Control | SupportWifi, SupportAutoConnect, StartAutoConnect, WiFiPair, GetBluetoothOnlineList |

### Phone → Adapter → Host (P→A→H) — Forwarded from Phone

**Firmware handler:** `fcn.0001d2fe` at `0x1da50` - receives via D-Bus from iAP handler

| ID | Action | Host Should |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 3 | RequestHostUI | Show native host UI (user tapped car/phone icon in CarPlay) |
| 14 | Hide | Hide projection view (user minimized CarPlay) |

### Adapter → Host (A→H) — Adapter Originated

These commands are **generated by the adapter** to notify the host of state changes. All are pure informational — **do NOT trigger session management actions**.

| ID Range | Group | Summary |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 500-509 | Focus (AA only) | RequestVideoFocus, ReleaseVideoFocus, audio focus variants, navi focus — Android Auto only |
| 1003-1011 | Connection Status | WiFi/BT scan results, connect/disconnect notifications |

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Command 1010 Clarification (Binary Verified Feb 2026)**

Command 1010 (`DeviceWifiNotConnected`) is a **WiFi hotspot status notification**, NOT a session termination signal.

- **Correct name:** `DeviceWifiNotConnected` (verified via `ARMadb-driver` binary disassembly at `0x19a64`)
- **Meaning:** The adapter's WiFi hotspot currently has no phone connected
- **When sent:** During initialization, periodically while idle, or when WiFi link drops
- **Host should:** Log status, update UI indicator, but **do NOT terminate active sessions**

For **USB CarPlay**: This command is completely irrelevant - data flows over USB, not WiFi. Ignore it.

For **Wireless CarPlay**: WiFi dropping doesn't mean the session has ended. Wait for:
- `Unplugged` (0x04) message for definitive session end
- `OnCarPlayPhase 0` for session termination
- Heartbeat timeout for connection loss

---

## IMPORTANT: Voice/Call Events Use AudioData, NOT Command

**Siri, phone calls, and navigation audio events are signaled via AudioData (0x07), not Command (0x08).**

For the authoritative audio command table with `decode_type` and `audio_type` per command, see `audio_protocol.md`.

### AudioData (0x07) Audio Commands

These are embedded in AudioData messages with a 13-byte payload when no audio data is present:

| AudioCmd | Name | Direction | Host Action |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | AUDIO_OUTPUT_START | P→A→H | Prepare audio playback |
| 2 | AUDIO_OUTPUT_STOP | P→A→H | Stop audio playback |
| 3 | AUDIO_INPUT_CONFIG | P→A→H | Configure mic input format |
| 4 | AUDIO_PHONECALL_START | P→A→H | **Start microphone capture** |
| 5 | AUDIO_PHONECALL_STOP | P→A→H | **Stop microphone capture** |
| 6 | AUDIO_NAVI_START | P→A→H | Duck media audio for navigation |
| 7 | AUDIO_NAVI_STOP | P→A→H | Restore media audio |
| 8 | AUDIO_SIRI_START | P→A→H | **Start microphone capture** |
| 9 | AUDIO_SIRI_STOP | P→A→H | **Stop microphone capture** |
| 10 | AUDIO_MEDIA_START | P→A→H | Media playback starting |
| 11 | AUDIO_MEDIA_STOP | P→A→H | Media playback stopped |
| 14 | AUDIO_INCOMING_CALL | P→A→H | Incoming call notification |

**Firmware handler:** `0x1a97e` - maps iAP audio signals to AudioSignal_* names

```

### Incorrect Assumption (Clarified)

The Command IDs `SiriButtonDown(5)` and `SiriButtonUp(6)` are for the **host to INITIATE Siri** (e.g., steering wheel button press), NOT for receiving Siri activation notifications from the phone.

## GPS/GNSS Commands

Commands 18 (StartGNSSReport) and 19 (StopGNSSReport) control GPS data forwarding from the head unit to the connected phone. See the [Command ID Reference Tables](#command-id-reference-tables) for their basic entries.

See `command_details.md` for StartGNSSReport/StopGNSSReport implementation details (binary evidence, prerequisites, firmware behavior) and `usb_protocol.md` > GnssData (0x29) for the complete GPS pipeline analysis (NMEA format, iAP2 conversion, GNSSCapability configuration, end-to-end data flow).

---

## Extended Command Formats

*Verified via USB capture (Jan 2026)*

Some Command packets (type 8) use extended payloads beyond the standard 4-byte command ID. These are identified by packet length > 20 bytes.

### Command 4 Extended: Phone Bluetooth MAC Notification (A→H)

When a phone connects, the adapter sends an extended Command 4 with the phone's Bluetooth MAC address:

| Offset | Size | Content | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | 4 | `04 00 00 00` | Command ID 4 (little-endian) |
| 4 | 17 | `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` | Bluetooth MAC address (ASCII, null-padded) |
| 21 | 3 | `e8 07 00` | Additional data (possibly year: 2024) |

**Captured Example (40-byte Command):**
```
Header: aa 55 aa 55 18 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 f7 ff ff ff
Payload: 04 00 00 00 36 34 3a 33 31 3a 33 35 3a 38 43 3a  |....64:31:35:8C:|
         32 39 3a 36 39 e8 07 00                          |29:69...|
```

**Context:** Sent by adapter after CarPlay phone connects to notify host of the phone's Bluetooth address for pairing/identification.

### TTY Log Correlation

Captured firmware logs confirm the mapping:

```
[D]2020-01-02 00:08:01.770 ARMadb-driver[Accessory_fd]: _SendPhoneCommandToCar: DeviceWifiConnected(1009)
[D]2020-01-02 00:08:00.769 ARMadb-driver[Accessory_fd]: _SendPhoneCommandToCar: DeviceWifiNotConnected(1010)
```

See the [Connection Status Commands (1000-1013)](#connection-status-commands-1000-1013---mixed-directions) table for the complete per-ID listing.

### Behavioral Analysis

**When 1010 is sent:**
1. During adapter initialization (no phone connected yet)
2. Periodically while idle/waiting for connection (~12s interval)
3. When WiFi link drops during wireless CarPlay session

**When 1010 is NOT a session termination:**
- For USB CarPlay: WiFi status is completely irrelevant (data flows over USB)
- For Wireless CarPlay: WiFi dropping doesn't immediately end session; may reconnect

**Actual session termination signals:**
- `Unplugged` (message type 0x04) - definitive phone disconnect
- `OnCarPlayPhase 0` - session ended
- Heartbeat timeout - USB connection lost

### Multi-Device Tracking

The adapter maintains a `DevList` array of known devices:
```json
"DevList": [
  {"id":"14:1B:A0:1E:DE:28", "type":"CarPlay", "name":"lePhone"},
  {"id":"F0:04:E1:81:0E:06", "type":"CarPlay", "name":"Matt"}
]
```

Command 1010 is a **general WiFi hotspot status**, not tied to a specific device. It indicates "no device currently connected to WiFi hotspot" regardless of which devices are in the DevList.
