[16] :: Video Frame Interval Change. Replaced Timer with coroutine Job. PUSHED: 10DEC25 11:50AM
[17] :: Navigation Audio Testing
[18] :: PlatformDetector was not used correctly, Fixed. Should now detected the hardware decoder and use it.

[26] :: Adapter Config settings option additions.
[27] :: Lint checks and some UI changes.
